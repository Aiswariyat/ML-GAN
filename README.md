# GAN Image Generation Project

This project focuses on using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate a set of 100 images for each of the 9 distinct patterns. My aim is to train a GAN model that learns to produce images that resemble the input patterns.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for training the GAN models.
- `models/`: Holds the trained GAN models for generating new images.
- `output/`: Stores the output images generated by the GAN models.
- `GAN.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook with the initial part of the project, including data preprocessing and model training.

## Patterns

The project generates images for the following patterns:

1. Center
2. Donut
3. Edge-Loc
4. Edge-Ring
5. Loc
6. Near-Full
7. None
8. Random
9. Scratch

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- TensorFlow 2.x
